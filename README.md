### Keyframe Animation
The .mb files and videos of the two walk cycles are in the folder Keyframe
Animation/.

### Mocap Animation
The python file (main.py) generating the BVH files for the two walk cycles
are in the folder Mocap Animation/. The resulting BVH files are under individual
folders sad/ and wave/.
